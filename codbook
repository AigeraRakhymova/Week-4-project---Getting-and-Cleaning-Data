The following information is the hightlights/summary of the 'feature_info.txt' and 'feature.txt'

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

  tBodyAcc-XYZ
  tGravityAcc-XYZ
  tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  tBodyGyro-XYZ
  tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
  tBodyAccMag
  tGravityAccMag
  tBodyAccJerkMag
  tBodyGyroMag
  tBodyGyroJerkMag
  fBodyAcc-XYZ
  fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  fBodyGyro-XYZ
  fBodyAccMag
  fBodyAccJerkMag
  fBodyGyroMag
  fBodyGyroJerkMag
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

  gravityMean
  tBodyAccMean
  tBodyAccJerkMean
  tBodyGyroMean
  tBodyGyroJerkMean
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

  mean(): Mean value
  std(): Standard deviation
  mad(): Median absolute deviation 
  max(): Largest value in array
  min(): Smallest value in array
  sma(): Signal magnitude area
  energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
  iqr(): Interquartile range 
  entropy(): Signal entropy
  arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
  correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
  maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
  meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
  skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
  kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
  bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
  angle(): Angle between to vectors.
Unit:
Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. In other words, they are unitless.

Original data sets: selected input data variables
Based on the requirement of the course project, I only selected those input variables related to the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. (see the section of "Instruction and Requirements" in README.md)

Tidy data sets
Tiday data set: new variable names
New variable names were from selected input data variables (see previous section)

The names were modified mainly to avoid any unnecessary errors in R when this tidy data set is used as an input data during any data analysis in the future. The methods and reasons are based on the instruction from the course video-sildes (Week 4: Editing text variables).

The following were modified: -- lower cases; removed bad characters "()"; replaced "-" to "."
The activity names are also be modified such as: lower cases; removed "_" new activity names: laying, sitting, standing, walking, walkingdownstairs and walkingupstairs.

Tidy data set: data structure
There are 180 observations of 68 variables.
